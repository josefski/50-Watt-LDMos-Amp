# 50-Watt-LDMos-Amp
A 50 Watt HF Amp that uses modern parts 

This is mostly clanker code for a raspberry pi pico controlled protection loop and operation control for a 50 watt HF Amplifier that uses modern LDmos transistors instead of the IRF series mosfets that are 50 years old and inappropriate for this purpose.
